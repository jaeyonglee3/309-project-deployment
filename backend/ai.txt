AI Usage for CSC309 Assignment 2

I wrote all the code for this assignment myself, including the initial implementation. I used AI (Claude/Cursor) only as a debugging assistant when I encountered errors. Here's my development process:

1. INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION (My Work)
   - Read the assignment specification and designed the API structure independently
   - Wrote the Prisma schema by referencing the Prisma documentation
   - Implemented all Express routes and middleware myself
   - Created the authentication logic and permission checks on my own
   - Wrote all business logic and validation rules

2. TESTING APPROACH
   - Created comprehensive test cases to validate my API endpoints
   - Set up side-by-side testing with the reference backend API provided by the course
   - Made parallel calls to both my implementation and the reference API
   - Compared responses to ensure my implementation matched expected behavior
   - Identified discrepancies and fixed them independently

3. DEBUGGING WITH AI ASSISTANCE
   - When I encountered errors, I asked AI to help identify the issue
   - Used AI to understand error messages from the autotester
   - Asked for clarification on HTTP status code ordering (400, 401, 403, 404)
   - Got help fixing syntax errors and debugging runtime issues
   - AI helped me spot logic errors in my code that I had already written

4. MY LEARNING PROCESS
   - All architectural and design decisions were made by me
   - I understood every line of code in my implementation
   - AI never generated full route implementations - I wrote them myself
   - AI only helped me fix bugs in code I had already written

The final implementation is entirely my own work, with AI serving only as a debugging tool to help me fix errors more efficiently.
