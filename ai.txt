**AI Usage for CSC309 Assignment 2 - Frontend**

We wrote all the frontend code for this assignment ourselves, including the initial implementation. We used AI (Claude/Cursor) only as a debugging assistant when we encountered errors. Here's our development process:

1. **INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION (Our Work)**
   - Read the assignment specification and designed the component structure independently
   - Implemented all React components and pages ourselves
   - Created the routing structure and navigation logic
   - Wrote all UI components and styling
   - Implemented authentication context and protected routes
   - Created all user-facing pages (points, QR codes, transfers, etc.)

2. **TESTING APPROACH**
   - Tested all pages manually in the browser
   - Verified API integration with the backend
   - Tested authentication flow and role-based access
   - Validated form submissions and data display

3. **DEBUGGING WITH AI ASSISTANCE**
   - When we encountered errors, we asked AI to help identify the issue
   - Used AI to understand React error messages
   - Asked for clarification on React hooks and state management
   - Got help fixing syntax errors and debugging runtime issues
   - AI helped us spot logic errors in code we had already written

4. **OUR LEARNING PROCESS**
   - All architectural and design decisions were made by us
   - We understood every line of code in our implementation
   - AI never generated full component implementations — we wrote them ourselves
   - AI only helped us fix bugs in code we had already written

5. **TYPESCRIPT TO JSX CONVERSION**
   - Converted all TypeScript files (.tsx) to JavaScript files (.jsx) as required
   - Removed TypeScript type annotations while preserving all functionality
   - Ensured all components worked correctly after conversion

The final implementation is entirely our own work, with AI serving only as a debugging tool to help us fix errors more efficiently.
