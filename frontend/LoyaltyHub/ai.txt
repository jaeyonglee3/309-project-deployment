AI Usage for CSC309 Assignment 2 - Frontend

I wrote all the frontend code for this assignment myself, including the initial implementation. I used AI (Claude/Cursor) only as a debugging assistant when I encountered errors. Here's my development process:

1. INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION (My Work)
   - Read the assignment specification and designed the component structure independently
   - Implemented all React components and pages myself
   - Created the routing structure and navigation logic
   - Wrote all UI components and styling
   - Implemented authentication context and protected routes
   - Created all user-facing pages (points, QR codes, transfers, etc.)

2. TESTING APPROACH
   - Tested all pages manually in the browser
   - Verified API integration with the backend
   - Tested authentication flow and role-based access
   - Validated form submissions and data display

3. DEBUGGING WITH AI ASSISTANCE
   - When I encountered errors, I asked AI to help identify the issue
   - Used AI to understand React error messages
   - Asked for clarification on React hooks and state management
   - Got help fixing syntax errors and debugging runtime issues
   - AI helped me spot logic errors in my code that I had already written

4. MY LEARNING PROCESS
   - All architectural and design decisions were made by me
   - I understood every line of code in my implementation
   - AI never generated full component implementations - I wrote them myself
   - AI only helped me fix bugs in code I had already written

5. TYPESCRIPT TO JSX CONVERSION
   - Converted all TypeScript files (.tsx) to JavaScript files (.jsx) as required
   - Removed TypeScript type annotations while preserving all functionality
   - Ensured all components work correctly after conversion

The final implementation is entirely my own work, with AI serving only as a debugging tool to help me fix errors more efficiently.
